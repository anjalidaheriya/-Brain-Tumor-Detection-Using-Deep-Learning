# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

This project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to detect brain tumors from MRI images.  
The goal is to provide an automated, accurate, and fast classification system for assisting doctors in medical diagnosis.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses **deep learning (Keras + TensorFlow)** for image classification
- Supports **binary classification**: Tumor vs. No Tumor
- Preprocessing pipeline for MRI images (resizing, normalization, augmentation)
- Visualization of training and validation metrics
- Easy to adapt for custom medical datasets

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
You can use the **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset** from Kaggle or other open sources.  
Example: [Brain Tumor MRI Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
